## Introduction

A recreation of a very famous block dropping game. 

Rendered in a 3D environment using OpenGL.

This should be considered a “complete” demo (start screen, playable game, game over screen). There are loads that could be added or improved on but it’s probably enough for a Minimal Viable Product and demo purposes. And as always, there are other projects and ideas to work on.
